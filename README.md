# DJALM
'DJALM... what?' You may ask. The name comes from: `Disable Join And Leave Messages`

DJALM is a basic plugin, it disables join and leave messages!

# Configure Plugin 
To add it on your server, download the .phar and put it on your plugins folder. Yes that simple! 
If you would later like to re-enable join or leave (or both) messages, the config.yml has you back!
